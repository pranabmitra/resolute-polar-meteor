## Objectives overview:

The webapp should display a form for children to enter their id and a free text message to santa.

When submitting the form, the server should check:
 1. that the child is registered
 2. that the child is less than 10 years old.
To this purpose, the server can fetch user and profiles data in JSON format from:
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alj-devops/santa-data/master/userProfiles.json
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alj-devops/santa-data/master/users.json

If the child is not registered (no match for the user id) or more than 10years old, the webapp should display a basic error page with an error message explaining the problem.\
If the child is registered and less than 10 years old, the server should show a page indicating that the request has been received.

Every 15seconds, the server should send an email with information on all pending (not yet sent) requests including:
- child username (eg. charlie.brown)
- child's address (eg. 219-1130, Ikanikeisaiganaibaai, Musashino-shi, Tokyo)
- request free text as was input in the form

Email sender should be set as do_not_reply@northpole.com, and sent to santa@northpole.com

## Detailed instructions:

- should fetch the JSON data at every form submission (consider it as an API)
- to get an smtp server for emails, go to https://ethereal.email/ and click "Create Ethereal Account".\
This will give you an account (take note of your username and pwd if you need to re-logon later) and smtp server (actual emails do not get delivered).\
Go to https://ethereal.email/messages to see the emails that have been received by the smtp server.
